# Search Beacon
My final project whilst i was at Spiced Academy - a 12 week full stack coding bootcamp.

Search Beacon lets charites and non profits find volunteers, and vice versa. Once registered, users can set up a profile, message each other and search for oppurtunities via a map or by keywords (powered by PSQL's full text search). 

Made in 1 week with ReactJs/React-Redux and using the google places and maps apis. 

## Still to do:

Improvments to be made to the messaging functions and mobile layouts.
