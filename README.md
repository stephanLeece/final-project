# Search Beacon
My final project whilst i was at Spiced Academy - a 12 week full stack coding bootcamp.

Search Beacon lets charites and non profits find volunteers, and vice versa. Once registered, users can set up a profile, message each other and search for oppurtunities via a map or by keywords. 

## Technologies
