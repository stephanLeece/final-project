# Search Beacon
My final project whilst I was at Spiced Academy - a 12 week full stack coding bootcamp.

Search Beacon lets charities and non profits find volunteers, and vice versa. Once registered, users can set up a profile, message each other and search for opportunities via a map or by keywords. 

## Technologies
- **Language**: Javascript
- **Frontend**: ReactJS, Redux
- **Backend**: Node, Express
- **Databases**: PostgreSQL, AWS S3

## Notes:
Improvements still to be made to the messaging functions and mobile layout.
